# netlify-starter

_**NOTE: Documentation in progress**_

My basic project starter for Netlify (hosted) projects.

Includes dependencies I commonly use when bootsrapping a new Netlify project.

Sets up a barebones React PWA front-end with a Netlify function that can be used on the back-end.

## Getting started

1. `git clone https://github.com/mikesprague/netlify-starter.git your-project-name`
1. `cd your-project-name`
1. `rm -rf .git && git init`
1. `yarn`
